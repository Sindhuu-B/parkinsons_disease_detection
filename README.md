<b> Parkinson's Disease Detection </b>
<br>
<br>
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects movement and motor control. It occurs due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, leading to symptoms such as tremors, muscle rigidity, slowness of movement (bradykinesia), and postural instability. Early detection of Parkinson’s Disease is crucial, as timely medical intervention can significantly improve a patient’s quality of life.
